# 242 Days of DSA Practice

This is my personal 242 days of code challenge focused on improving my DSA skills. I will be practicing DSA problems daily using this [Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14cQ3Br2l4fyh3_E1ht_8BNXB8COTDft7nn36-7MnZFE/edit?usp=sharing) , and I'll be sharing my progress on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Adithya-Sakaray/).

## Motivation

The goal of this challenge is to strengthen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, and to become proficient in solving programming problems related to DSA.

## Rules

- Solve minimum one DSA problem every day for the next 242 days.
- Share progress daily on GitHub.
- Practice using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.
- Learn a new concept related to DSA every week.

## Progress

I'll be updating my progress daily on [GitHub](https://github.com/Adithya-Sakaray/DSA/), and you can follow along to see what I'm working on and what I'm learning.
## Conclusion

I'm excited to improve my DSA skills through this 242 days of code challenge, and I hope to become a proficient problem solver by the end of it. If you're also doing the challenge, feel free to start the challenge with this [Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14cQ3Br2l4fyh3_E1ht_8BNXB8COTDft7nn36-7MnZFE/edit?usp=sharing) and let's support each other!
